00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 My name is Fernando and I'm from Colombia. 

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
 And I had an opportunity 

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,300
 to take an internship there last summer. 

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,300
 Maybe you are wondering: 

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,300
 why should I host someone? 

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,300
 Why should I give him my bed 

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
 my food or my space? 

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
 But maybe you should ask yourself: 

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,300
 why should I welcome someone to my life? 

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,300
 And I think the best things in life, 

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,300
 you get them when you go for them. 

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,300
 And when you take the risk to go for them you know. 

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
 And I think it's completely worth it 

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
 to take the risk is welcome someone 

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
 is your life 'cause at the end of the day 

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,500
 you just have someone 

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,300
 who're just making jokes 

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,900
 or just cooking food 

21
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
 or just hangin ' around with. 

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
 And now That person 

23
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
 Became just your brother or sister 

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
 and you wonder like: how? 

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
 How did it happen? 

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,900
 You know, just in 6 weeks. 

27
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,900
 So it happened because 

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,900
 to open your heart 

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900
 and Provide him an amazing experience. 

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,900
 So I really Encourage you to keep providing 

31
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,900
 Those experiences and ... 

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,000
 have a lot of new friends.  Subtitles End: mo.dbxdb.com
