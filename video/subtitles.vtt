Hey Krakow! What's up? 

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 My name is Fernando and I'm from Colombia. 

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.300
 And I had an opportunity 

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 to take an internship there last summer. 

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
 Maybe you are wondering: 

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300
 why should I host someone? 

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 Why should I give him my bed 

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 my food or my space? 

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 But maybe you should ask yourself: 

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 why should I welcome someone to my life? 

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.300
 And I think the best things in life, 

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 you get them when you go for them. 

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.000
And when you take the risk to go for them you know. 

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.300
And I think it's completely worth it 

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 to take the risk to welcome someone 

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.300
to your life 'cause at the end of the day 

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.500
you just have someone 

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.300
who're just making jokes 

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.900
or just cooking food 

20
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.900
or just hangin' around with. 

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.900
And now that person 

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900
just became your brother or sister 

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.900
and you wonder like: how? 

24
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900
How did it happen? 

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900
You know, just in 6 weeks. 

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.900
So it happened, because 

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
to open your heart 

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.900
and provide him an amazing experience. 

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.500
So I really encourage you to keep providing 

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.900
those experiences and ... 

31
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.500
have a lot of new friends.
